<h3>Building permits are required in order to determine whether all new construction or substantial improvements are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.</li>
<li>Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.</li> 
<li>Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.</li> 
</ol>

<h3>Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall also be included with the application for development within the flood plain area.</h3>

<p><strong>A</strong>. For structures to be elevated to the base flood elevation:</p>
<ol>
<li> A plan showing the site of the proposed structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.</li>

<li>A determination of elevations of the existing ground, proposed finished ground, and lowest floor, certified by a registered professional engineer, survey or architect.</li>

<li>Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure, includes details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls, foundations, erosions protection measures, etc. When required by the building inspector, these plans shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer or architect. </li>

<li>Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to the base flood elevation at the building site.</li></ol>

<p><strong>B.</strong> For structures to be flood proofed to the base flood elevation (nonresidential structures only):</p>
<ol>
<li>Plans showing details of all flood-proofing measures, prepared by a registered professional engineer or architect, and showing the size of the proposed structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.</li>

<li>A determination of elevations of existing ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood-proofing limits and certified by a registered professional engineer, surveyor, or architect.</li>

<li>A certificate prepared by the registered professional engineer or architect who prepared the plans in  #1 above, that the structure in questions, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Below the base flood elevation, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water.</li>

<li>The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities, pressures, and other factors associated with the base flood.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<h3> The owner or developer of any proposed subdivision, manufactured home park or sub-division or other development shall submit a site plan to the building inspector which includes the following information.</h3>
<ol>

<li> Name of engineer, surveyor, or other qualified person responsible for providing the information required in this section.</li>

<li>A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or development with respect to the municipality's flood plain areas, proposed lots and sites, fills, flood or erosion protective facilities and areas subject to special deed restrictions. In addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments greater than 50 lots of five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.</li>

<li>Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or completely in the flood plain areas, the plan map shall include detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify accurately the boundaries of the flood plain area.</li></ol>
